# What does a Machine Learning Researcher do?

Ben Kandel is an Applied Machine Learning Researcher who has worked at PointClickCare for the past couple of years. He was an amazing person to talk to and really gave insight on what it is that a Machine Learning Researcher does.

PointClickCare is a cloud-based healthcare company that creates and maintains software for health institutions. They create products that help health institutions with their clinical practices and financial situations. More info on PointClickCare can be found [here](https://pointclickcare.com/).

At PointClickCare, Ben works with medical data to build models for their clients. Some projects he has worked on deal with re-hospitalization as a notable portion of people who get hospitalized return back to the hospital within 30 days. He has worked with clients in hopes to reduce that number to a more manageable amount.

# How to become a Machine Learning Researcher?

## What you should study?

Before becoming a Machine Learning Researcher, Ben Kandel studied physics in undergrad with a minor in mathematics and chemistry. For his graduate studies, he has a PHD in bioengineering with a focus on Machine Learning for medical applications. That doesn't necessarily mean that you should follow in his foot steps. Talking with Ben, he expressed that your academic studies should reflect your desired career. 

Currently, the new hot and ***sexiest*** job, according to Harvard Business Review, is being a Data Scientist. Ben Kandel expresses his opinion on this job title as it has a lot of overlap with other jobs such as his. He claims that Data Scientist jobs are a mixed bag and you really need to look and understand your responsibilities before you accept an offer. Some jobs that were previously listed as Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Statistician and Data Engineer are now listed as Data Scientist. Ben says that these problems/jobs should probably have their own solutions but "as of 2022 it's not" and will probably be solved with the hiring of a Data Scientist. Due to this wide range of specialties and skills, you don't necessarily need a PHD to become a Data Scientist. In the end, Ben stated that, PHDs are not necessary but it generally prepares you for different types of jobs that you wouldn't usually be able to get without one.

It also depends on the field and instution. If the field/institution is well-known to have a rigorous and standardized path to have research accepted, then usually those jobs require credential and publication-heavy applicants. It also depends on how important the accuracy of the model is. Obviously, the more accurate the model, the better but different fields have different consequences for inaccurate models. For example, there is a difference in consequence between a revenue prediction model and a model that predicts early symptoms of a life-threatening disease. 

So what type of credentials do we actually need? According to Ben, you can never go wrong taking some classes machine learning or data scientist. Having a maths background can be very useful as well. If you know exactly what field/industry you want to go into then, taking some domain-specific classes will be very useful. If you want to go into the more engineering intense roles, then software engineering and computer science classes will be very useful.

## How to prepare outside of being academics?

One question that was asked to Ben was, "What kind of qualifications/skills should you work on that they don't teach you in academics?". The response was that interpersonal skills are a very nice thing to have. Especially when you are in the industry, it is important not only to make models but also knowing how to explain how it works and why it works to executives and clients. A tool, no matter how powerful it is, is useless in the hands of someone who doesn't know how to use it. Also, a lot of research is done through teams and group effort. It is important to know how to work with people.

Next up, Ben talked about the experience people should have. If you are fresh out of school, or if this is your first machine learning/data science job then your personal projects are important. Here Ben stated that what he looks for when looking at candidates with personal projects is that there is some sort of novelty factor in the project and, more importantly, that the person knows why they are taking the steps they took. For example, anyone can follow a tutorial and a standardized process. What ensures that you know what you are doing is that you are able to explain the decisions you took. For example, why you chose certain models over others and why you decided to engineer specific features.

If you are applying to a more senior-level position, then what is important is your past work experiences. Ben stated that what he looks at with those candidates are the results they were able to obtain when working there. For example, what projects did you work on, and how those projects were used by the company. It becomes more impressive if you can list tangible and quantifiable benefits that your previous company experienced like "my model increased our profit margins by 10%".

For specifically machine learning, Ben stated that knowing some statistics is very useful.

# Academia vs. Industry

Having both a PHD and a job at PointClickCare, Ben has experience both in academia and industry. He states that academia and industry are the correct choices for different kinds of people.

For academia, you should get into it if you absolutely can't stand the idea of working for someone, according to Ben. You have more freedom to research what you want. It isn't complete freedom as instead of having the freedom to perform any research you want, you have the freedom to guess want funding agencies are willing to fund. That being said it is more freedom than in industry. You also effectively become your own boss as you can choose who want to work with. This is also a good choice if you like taking responsibility and getting recognition for your discoveries. The research found in academia usually has your name slapped all over the paper and people will look to you as the expert.

Industry gives you more stability as you don't have to keep applying for grants and it usually pays more. That being said, you are stuck with performing the tasks you are given but intuitively you have only gotten that job because you enjoy what you will do there. You can always look for another job if you wanna research something else but that does require you to get used to a whole new environment. This is also a good choice if you don't mind sharing the glory or if you don't like taking full responsibility if any problems occur. In industry, papers are usually attributed to the organization that published them rather than the specific people who did the research. That doesn't mean that you don't get any acknowledgment. It is just that the acknowledgment is shared between you and the organization.

# How to further your career?

Even after you get a job as a data scientist/machine learning researcher, your journey isn't finished. This field is ever-growing and ever-advancing so the pursuit of knowledge is never over. You should always be looking at new models and paradigms. Ben has stated that his favourite model is the Random Forest model as it is a good baseline model and it's very easy to use since it is non-parametric.

Asking Ben for some resources that he uses to keep up with everything, he gave some good recommendations. He says that he keeps up by keeping tabs on some Reddit communities, blogs, hacker news, and publications. Some he did shout out was the [machine learning subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/) and [The-Gradient](https://medium.com/the-gradient) blog. He did say that is impossible to keep up with everything so don't feel pressured to ensure you're up to date 24/7 but having a list of resources you can scroll through in your free time can be very advantageous.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, Ben Kandel was a great person to interview and the insights he gave to the whole data science/machine learning/statistician field have been really useful. Seeing as I am only recently starting out my career, I will definitely take his advice to heart.
